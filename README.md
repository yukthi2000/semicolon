### Technology used:
#### The main technologies used for the development of the project are ReactJS,NodeJS and MySQL. the ReactJS is used for this web development because of its flexibility and code reusability.React is an excellent tool to develop more user interactve and attractive websites and most importantly its potential to reuse components is significant. NodeJS and MySQL is used for the development of the backend. NodeJS allows to use javascript for both frontend and backend of the system and allows language sharing across the stack. other than that Node is a reliable and fast tool for interactive websites.

* The code of the project is merged and pushed to the dev branch not in the main branch. After fixing the errors and conflicts genenrated, it will be pushed to the main branch. Every developer has a personal pranch in the dev branch.testing branches have been created for the testing purposes.*
